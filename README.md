# Instructions

Create a simple web dashboard using Angular.
Task 1 -
Read and display data given in `products.json` in a tabular format.
The dashboard should have the following functionalities - 
  - There should be a login screen. Only permitted users should be allowed to view the dashboard. Assume for now username to be `admin` and password to be `admin123`. Hard code this user.
  - There should be a way to sort the data based on **all** the given fields (e.g. user should be able to see all the items by Price High to Low, as well as Low to High)
  - There should be a search button which would allow the user to search based on the `title` field.

Task 2 -
  Create a route -> /aboutUs
  Should be lazyly loaded. i.e. client code should only be downloaded in browser when user navigates to this URI.
  Page should show text -> 'ABOUT US PAGE'

You would be evaluated on - 
   - Functionality
   - Code structure
   - Naming conventions and best practices
   - How well the dashboard behaves on different type of data (string length, etc)
